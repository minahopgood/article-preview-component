### What I learned

This was my first real, on my own project using JavaScript. I fought for my life the whole time, and it still isn't finished. I am currently trying to play around with JS a bit more before I come back to this project because at the moment it is very unfinished -- no active states, a desktop media query that looks crazy. Between trying to get better at JavaScript, I neglected this project as well as all HTML and CSS I put into it. In summary, I have learned the importance of using comments to explain to your future self what the hell your code does.

### Continued development

I plan to come back to this project in the future with more JS under my belt, and hopefully a few other projects so this will be a breeze instead of what it was. Which was a nightmare.
